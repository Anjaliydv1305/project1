    <h1>Bread ka Halwa</h1>

   <img height="500" width="400" src="images/breadimg.jpeg" alt="">

   <h4><strong>Bread Halwa (Bread Sheera)</strong> is a delicious Indian sweet or dessert made using bread slices and a handful of ingredients. </h4>

   <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
   <p><strong> Bread – </strong>White milk bread or sweet white bread slices are best for making this halwa. I don’t prefer using brown bread or other hard bread, and I don’t use stale bread. If the bread is not fresh, it crumbles a lot while frying, making the ghee unusable for multiple batches. <br>
    You can also use sweet buns instead of bread and call it bun halwa. <br>
    <strong>Ghee -</strong> This halwa is cooked in ghee. Do not replace it with oil; it won’t taste good. <br>
    <strong>Nuts -</strong> I have used cashew nuts and almonds, but you can add other nuts like pistachios, walnuts, etc. Some people garnish this delicious dessert with melon seeds, also. <br>
    <strong>Sugar -</strong> Granulated white sugar is used to sweeten the halwa. You can replace sugar with powdered jaggery or brown sugar if you wish. <br>
    <strong>Cardamom Powder -</strong>Use it to flavor the halwa. <br>
    You can add some saffron strands to make the halwa more flavorful. <br>

   <h2>How To Make Bread Halwa</h2> <br>
   <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>Cut the brown edges of 6 white bread slices using a sharp serrated knife and cut the slices into 4 pieces.</li> <br>
    <li>Heat 2 cups of ghee for frying in a shallow pan over medium heat.</li> <br>
    <li>Once the ghee is hot, deep fry the bread pieces in batches until golden brown.</li> <br>
    <li>Keep flipping the pieces using tongs while frying so that they fry evenly on all sides.</li> <br>
    <li>Drain on a plate and set aside. <br> <strong>Note</strong> – Do not over-fry the bread; the halwa will not taste good. The residual heat will cause the bread to keep browning a little. <br>
        <strong>Tip</strong>  – Strain the leftover ghee using a fine-mesh strainer and use it to make other sweets. 
         </li>  <br>
   
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon ghee in a pan over medium heat.</li> <br>
        <li>Add 10-12 almonds (coarsely crushed) and 10-12 cashew nuts (coarsely crushed) and fry until golden brown. Stir frequently while frying.</li> <br>
        <li>Add ½ cup granulated white sugar and 1 cup water to the pan.</li> <br>
        <li>Cook until sugar is dissolved, stirring frequently.</li><br>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Now add the fried bread slices to the pan and cook for 8-10 minutes until the halwa leaves the sides of the pan.</li> <br>
        <li>Keep mashing the halwa with the back of a ladle.</li> <br>
        <li>Once the halwa is cooked, add ½ teaspoon of cardamom powder and mix well.</li>
